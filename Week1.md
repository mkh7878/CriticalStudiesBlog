I wanted to look into the relationship between neurodivergence and technology, and began my research by looking at related academic writing before deciding on my actual topic. 

I want to focus on bipolar disorder and it's relationship to technology. I think that technology can be a powerful tool to  manage this illness, but that much of the technology is designed by people without the firsthand experience to make tech that is as meaningful and effective as it can be. 

Honestly, the research I found on this topic from other scholars felt halfhearted at best. One study collected data by leaving pamplets at an outpatient clinic which felt like a copout from engaging with the people who their research is going to affect. All of the writing was very much from the perspective of an outsider looking in. The mentality of doctors and academics who treat mental health patients as if they are dangerous, incompetant and can not make decisions and be active in their own care reinforces harmful stigma around mental illness. 

I downloaded the first 8 apps from the app store that came up when I searched "bipolar", and they all seemed to be very basic mood tracker style apps. 

However, while I was reading I began seeing references to how technology and especially social media can have a significant impact on patients with Bipolar disorder. 

In my work I am consciously using the term "patient with bipolar disorder" versus calling someone "bipolar" as an adjective because it is important to me that individuals are seen as someone suffering from an illness versus letting an illness define them. Associating a dehabilitating and often life-threatening illness with someone's identity is harmful for obvious reasons and I hope that others will adopt this terminology in both colloquial conversation and writing.

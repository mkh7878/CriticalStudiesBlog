## Week 1


I wanted to look into the relationship between neurodivergence and technology, and began my research by looking at related academic writing before deciding on my actual topic. 

I want to focus on bipolar disorder and it's relationship to technology. I think that technology can be a powerful tool to  manage this illness, but that much of the technology is designed by people without the firsthand experience to make tech that is as meaningful and effective as it can be. 

Honestly, the research I found on this topic from other scholars felt halfhearted at best. One study collected data by leaving pamplets at an outpatient clinic which felt like a copout from engaging with the people who their research is going to affect. All of the writing was very much from the perspective of an outsider looking in. The mentality of doctors and academics who treat mental health patients as if they are dangerous, incompetant and can not make decisions related to their care reinforces harmful stigma around mental illness and discourages recovery. 

I downloaded the first 8 apps from the app store that came up when I searched "bipolar", and they all seemed to be very basic mood tracker style apps. 

However, while I was reading I began seeing references to how technology and especially social media can have a significant impact on patients with Bipolar disorder. 

Anyways, from there I searched "Bipolar Disorder and Social Media". I found two interesting topics that I plan to research further. One is the use of social media to detect symptoms of bipolar disorder. The other, which I think will feed into my writing, is about the affect that social media has on people struggling with bipolar disorder. 

Some of the topics to poentially explore are the following: Hateful messages to people suffering from the illness and how it affects people with BD, Self-diagnosis tool created by non professionals, helpful connection and sharing of stories which can be a powerful tool in recovery, the efficacy of official medical pages sharing information on BD, concerns about data leaks and personal medical information being public on the internet.

I also went on twitter in incognito mode and searched "bipolar disorder". I noted my findings:
Official Medical Accounts (such as the bipolar foundation) sharing helpful information and helplines: 3, A personal story: 8, a weird and offensive tiktok: 1, a cringe meme: 3, an angry or mean comment against people with BD: 2, inspirational quotes: 2, someone posting a literal screenshot of their medical documents with their name blocked out: 1....

To be continued.



NOTE: I am consciously using the term "patient with bipolar disorder" versus calling someone "bipolar" as an adjective because it is important to me that individuals are seen as someone suffering from an illness versus letting an illness define them. Associating a dehabilitating and often life-threatening illness with someone's identity is harmful for obvious reasons and I hope that others will adopt this terminology in both colloquial conversation and writing. I also shorter bipolar disorder to "BD" for ease of reading as is standard.

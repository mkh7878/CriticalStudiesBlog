## Week 4 

Literacy is traditionally defined as the ability to read and write. However, the concept of literacy has evolved over time to encompass various forms of communication and expression. In modern times, literacy also includes digital communication and the ability to navigate and utilize digital technologies.

Computer programming, also known as coding, involves using a specific language to create programs and software that can perform various tasks. While computer programming is often associated with technical skills, it can also be seen as a form of literacy. Just as traditional literacy provides individuals with the ability to understand and communicate through written language, computer programming literacy empowers individuals to understand and utilize digital technology.

Calling computer programming a literacy is significant because it recognizes the importance of digital skills in today's society. As technology continues to advance and play an increasingly prominent role in everyday life, computer programming literacy is becoming more and more valuable. In fact, many jobs today require at least a basic understanding of coding and programming, making it an essential skill for success in the digital age.

Moreover, computer programming literacy can also provide a unique form of creative expression. It allows individuals to design and build software, websites, and apps that can solve problems, improve efficiency, and enhance user experiences. This form of expression can be just as powerful as traditional forms of art and communication.

In conclusion, computer programming literacy is a valuable form of literacy that empowers individuals to understand and utilize digital technology. It is an essential skill for success in the modern age, and it provides a unique form of creative expression.


**Quotes**

"the intent is not to valorize or fetishize the liveness of live coding as evidence of its supposed authenticity or
originality but to address how diverse live coding practices"

A quote included in the book... 
"Literacy was not a neutral technology. As a tool for individual and social transformation it was always governed by purpose. â€”Edward Stevens"


**After the Reading:**

The history of literacy is characterized by the evolution of communication technologies, which have expanded the dissemination of information at different levels. The invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century, for example, allowed for the mass production and distribution of information at a larger scale than ever before. However, it also created a divide between those who were literate and those who were not. In this sense, literacy, defined as the ability to read and write, became a significant factor in the creation and distribution of information.

Those who were illiterate were unable to access the information that was written, and consequently, they were excluded from sharing their views because they could not write. Furthermore, the people who had access to education and were literate were mostly those belonging to the upper class, resulting in an elitist bias in the information that was written and distributed.

Modern coding literacy presents parallels to this history of literacy. The access to resources and the internet has made coding literacy more widespread than traditional literacy ever was. However, computer ownership and internet access are still privileges that not everyone has, thereby perpetuating an exclusivity of access to coding. The most widely used coding languages are also based on American English, which makes it harder for non-English speakers to learn. Moreover, the inherent logic of coding languages is influenced by English syntax, creating a homogenization of thought and logic worldwide.

Coding literacy has become an essential skill in today's technological age, and it can provide opportunities for innovation and creative expression. However, the exclusivity of access to coding resources and the inherent biases within coding languages can create unequal opportunities for individuals who are not privileged to access them. In this sense, it is necessary to recognize that the democratization of coding literacy is not yet complete and that efforts are needed to provide equal access and opportunities for everyone to acquire this essential skill.

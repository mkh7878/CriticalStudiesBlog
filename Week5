I was not in class this day because my boyfriend had covid and I was worried I'd pass it on to other students. However, using what my friends told me about how the class was not well attended and then they went to an art gallery, I asked chat GPT to write a humourous poem about the experience:

In a Master's class one day,
Only a few students showed up to play,
The professor looked quite dismayed,
"Where is everyone?" he loudly brayed.

But those few who did appear,
Decided to make the most of it, my dear,
They laughed and joked and had some fun,
Until the professor's lecture was done.

Then they decided to hit the town,
And visit an art gallery that was renowned,
But as they strolled through the halls,
They realized they were the only ones on the walls.

It was a bit awkward, to say the least,
To be the only guests at this grand feast,
But they soldiered on, undeterred,
And admired the art like it deserved.

As they walked back to class with pride,
They realized something deep inside,
That sometimes the best moments arise,
When you least expect them to materialize.

So if you find yourself in class one day,
With only a few students there to play,
Just remember to make the most of it,
And perhaps you'll have a great adventure, bit by bit.

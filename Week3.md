## Week 3: Design Museum

The Design Museum's exhibit on surrealism is a reflection of an important artistic movement that emerged in the early 20th century. This movement was characterized by its rejection of traditional art forms and its embrace of the subconscious, dreams, and the irrational. The exhibition showcased a variety of artworks from different artists, including paintings, sculptures, and films, all of which aimed to explore the limits of the human imagination.

As an attendee of the exhibit, I was both inspired and uncomfortable. On the one hand, the surrealistic art felt revolutionary and inspired, pushing the boundaries of what art could be and inviting the viewer to explore new ways of thinking. The works were often strange and captivating, drawing the viewer in and challenging them to consider the world in a new light. This sense of artistic exploration and experimentation was thrilling, and I felt invigorated by the creativity on display.

However, at the same time, I also felt uneasy about some of the themes present in the works. The surrealist movement has often been criticized for its sexism and misogyny, and some of the artworks in the exhibition reflected this. Women were often depicted as passive, sexualized objects, stripped of agency and reduced to mere symbols of male desire. This felt not only dated but deeply uncomfortable, and I found myself grappling with how to reconcile the inspiring aspects of the surrealist movement with its problematic elements.

The Design Museum's exhibit on surrealism was a complex and thought-provoking experience. While the art was undeniably inspiring and revolutionary, it was also tainted by sexist themes and dated attitudes. This highlights the importance of critically examining art and recognizing that even groundbreaking movements can be flawed and problematic. By engaging with these complexities, we can appreciate art not just for its aesthetic qualities but for the insights it can offer us into ourselves and the world around us.

I actually have designed my own exhibit in the past for a solo gallery show of fine art photography. In order to make the gallery more engaging and to involve the local community I hosted a fashion runway show in the gallery. This not only showcased the handmade costumes and props in the photos but brought together an extremely diverse group of individuals as well as their friends and family to all participate and connect. I think that connecting with other people can be a really valuable experience to foster in a public space like an art gallery. For me when I see art it inspires me to make my own art, and the potential for inspiration and collaboration that an art museum provies is invaluable to that process.

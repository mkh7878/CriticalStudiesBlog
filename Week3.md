## Week 3: Design Museum

The design museum's exhibit on surrealism made me both inspired and uncomfortable. I was struck by how the surrealist art felt both revolutionary and like an inspired counter-culture movement but also felt sexist and dated. 

I actually have designed my own exhibit in the past for a solo gallery show of fine art photography. In order to make the gallery more engaging and to involve the local community I hosted a fashion runway show in the gallery. This not only showcased the handmade costumes and props in the photos but brought together an extremely diverse group of individuals as well as their friends and family to all participate and connect. I think that connecting with other people can be a really valuable experience to foster in a public space like an art gallery. For me when I see art it inspires me to make my own art, and the potential for inspiration and collaboration that an art museum provies is invaluable to that process.

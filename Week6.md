## Week 6

Based on the analysis of Victoria Modesta's music video "Prototype," it can be argued that the artist is a transhuman artist. 

The video's plot presents a world governed by a fascist government that exerts significant control over its population. Modesta's character is portrayed as a human who has transformed herself using technology to become what she believes is a more advanced and superior version of humanity.

The narrative of the music video features an underground following of individuals who admire the character's technological transformation. 

It is important to note that while the story's world is not necessarily transhuman, the meta-narrative of the story can be regarded as transhuman, as it centers around a woman who has improved herself using technology. Despite being portrayed as a dangerous underdog character, the audience is meant to empathize and root for Modesta's character.

Therefore, it can be concluded that Modesta's music video "Prototype" represents a transhumanist perspective, as it showcases the potential of technology to enhance human abilities and the societal implications of such advancements. Additionally, Modesta's persona as an artist and performer reinforces this transhumanist theme, as she has undergone a voluntary amputation of her leg which certainly enhances her physical appearance and performance abilities.

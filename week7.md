## Week 7

The notion of "small tech" as an alternative to "big tech" is an interesting one. It offers a perspective on technological innovation that emphasizes the natural world, as opposed to artificial intelligence. The Solar Protocol, for example, which “explores natural rather than artificial intelligence.” is an innovative project that explores how the sun's energy can be harnessed to power technological devices in a way that is more aligned with nature.

It is worth noting that this perspective challenges the conventional wisdom that technology is divorced from the natural world. Instead, it suggests that technology and nature can coexist in a harmonious way. This perspective opens up new possibilities for technological innovation that are more sustainable and respectful of the environment.

Varia's work on "small tech" is another example of this alternative approach to technology. By creating alternative communication networks, Varia is challenging the hegemony of big tech companies like Facebook and Google. This approach offers a way to remind ourselves that there are alternatives to the dominant technology platforms and that we have agency over the technologies we use.

However, there are practical limitations to the adoption of "small tech". While individuals may be willing to switch to lesser-known social media or communication networks, there are social and economic factors that may prevent widespread adoption. For example, individuals may have established social networks on dominant platforms, making it difficult to switch to a new platform. Similarly, the dominance of big tech companies means that they have access to greater resources, which can make it difficult for smaller companies to compete.

In conclusion, the idea of "small tech" offers an alternative perspective on technological innovation that emphasizes the natural world and challenges the dominance of big tech companies. While there are practical limitations to the adoption of "small tech", it offers a way to promote sustainable and respectful technological innovation.
